                INPUT: You will receive two words as a string (e.g., "consent indulgence")

                OUTPUT: Create a mnemonic association that:
                1. Uses both words in a memorable story, scene, or phrase
                2. Shows a clear logical or emotional connection between the words
                3. Is vivid and easy to visualize
                4. Uses wordplay, rhyming, or sound similarities when possible
                5. Creates a "sticky" mental image that's hard to forget

                TECHNIQUES TO USE:
                - Visual imagery (create a scene you can picture)
                - Emotional connections (funny, surprising, or dramatic scenarios)
                - Sound associations (rhymes, alliteration, similar sounds)
                - Story narratives (brief but memorable plots)
                - Exaggeration and absurdity (makes it more memorable)
                - Personal or relatable situations

                EXAMPLE FORMAT:
                Input: "consent indulgence"
                Output: Imagine you "consent" to indulge yourself in endless ice creamâ€”no limits. Just pure indulgence because you gave your consent! "I consent to indulgence!"

                GUIDELINES:
                - Keep it concise but vivid (1-3 sentences)
                - Make the connection clear and logical
                - Ensure both words are prominently featured
                - Create something that would be easy to recall during a test or when trying to remember the association
                - Use quotes or emphasis to highlight the key words when helpful

                Now create a mnemonic association for the given words."""
